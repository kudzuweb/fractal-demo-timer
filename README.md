# Ghost Timer

A presentation timer that floats on your screen but is **invisible to screen sharing**. Perfect for keeping track of time during presentations without your audience seeing it.

## Requirements

- macOS
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed

## Usage

1. Clone this repo
2. Double-click `CLICK TO LAUNCH.command`

## Controls

| Action | Control |
|--------|---------|
| Start/Pause | ` (backtick) or click play button |
| Adjust time | Up/Down arrows or +/- buttons |
| Quit | Cmd+Q |

## How it works

The timer uses macOS content protection to exclude itself from screen capture, screen sharing, and AirPlay mirroring. You see it, your audience doesn't.
